Insights
-------

Finance View:
-----------

    Net Sales:

Net sales of the company had a steady growth from 29.11 million in 2018 to 3.74 billion in 2022 showing a hike each year this indicates extra-ordinary growth of the company. However, When compared to the targets to be achieved in the year 2022 the company was lagging behind by 1.86% in achieving the target provided. 

-	The trend in sales over the years indicates, the company always had higher Net sales from Oct to Dec every year. Therefore, management should look into factors which made the sales increase in this period and should try to implement accordingly. Also, decrease in sales each year from the start of December is seen each year the reason behind this should be found and taken care to prevent. 
-	Sales in each region had exceptional growth overtime except ‘Latin America’ where all sub-regions especially ‘columbo’  had least sales.
-	When looked into the products Networking Segment Product sales are declining over the past 3 year’s.

       Net Profit %:

NP Obtained is decreasing every year and had experienced profit only in the year 2019 with 2.21% of net sales. The company is expanding as we notice greater sales thus we can assume that the company at its initial face focuses on getting into the market rather than making profits. Also the company had a target of having a loss no more than 14.19% which has been achieved. 
 
- In 2022 est, the networking segment P&L Values are declining, upon examining the Market, EU Regions like France, Netherlands and Austria etc are the major areas of low business. These regions should be focused more in terms of networking segment Products.

Marketing View:
-----------

-	In the latest year 2022 we find that notebook have high net sales but the gross margin is least, pricing and discounts are to be taken care and segments like peripherals and accessories have low net sales and gross margin therefore more ads and promotions are to be made to improve the market for products under these segments.
-	Also the net profit % also has the same pattern of insights considering these segment products. Measures should be taken to increase the Gross margin and lower the operational costs to improve the net profit%.
